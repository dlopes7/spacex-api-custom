## PR Steps

**NOTE**: Make sure every change is covered by a unit test. If the change isn't
covered, make sure to add a test for it.

1. Fork the repo, make changes, add tests, commit, and submit a Pull Request

2. New Pull Requests will automatically trigger a CircleCI Build

3. If the build fails, look at the [Build Logs](https://circleci.com/gh/r-spacex/SpaceX-API).
Changes will not be merged unless the build passes

4. If the build succeeds, the pull request will be merged, and automatically
pushed to the production server at [https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/](https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/)

## Database additions / changes / updates

1. Open an issue with your correction, addition, or new data ideas

2. If approved, new data will be added to the database, and tests will be written to cover the new data
